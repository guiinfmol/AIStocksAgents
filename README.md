# AIStocksAgents

This repository contains an implementation of *["The highly intelligent virtual agents for modelling financial markets"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437115008079)* as part of my bachelor's final thesis at Universidad de Sevilla. The code is a faithful implementation and follows the design proposed by the authors.

Just do ```python App.py``` to run the system.
